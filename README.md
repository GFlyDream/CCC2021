I'm a (beginner) Java programmer who ***loves*** sharing my work. This repo will be updated as I progress in learning!

### I see something wrong
If you ever see something that can be improved in this repo, please, and I mean ***please*** contact me by creating a pull request. I'd love to work with you!
